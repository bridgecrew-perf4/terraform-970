This example is different than our previous examples, because we are actually exporting variables in the command line by running next commands: 
```
export TF_VAR_instance_type=t2.micro
export TF_VAR_image_id=ami-0be2609ba883822ec 
```
and we are deleting default values fromt the variables.tf file.
